## Installing pipenv 

In PowerShell navigate to the project's folder to install the PIPENV package manager:

    E:\git\self-study-python> python - m pip install pipenv

The virtual environment and the Pipfile will be created automatically.

In PowerShell allow scripts to be run (this is done only once) with the command:
	PS C:\Users\mkrast01> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

To start the virtual environment type "pipenv shell" or just open any file from the project's folder:

    E:\git\self-study-python> pipenv shell
    
To exit the virtual environment type "exit"
